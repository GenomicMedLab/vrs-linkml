  Entity:
    abstract: true
    description: >-
      Entity is the root class of ‘core’ classes model - those that have identifiers and other general
      metadata like labels, xrefs, urls, descriptions, etc. All core classes descend from and inherit
      its attributes.
    attributes:
      id:
        description: >-
          The 'logical' identifier of the entity in the system of record, e.g. a UUID. This 'id' is
          unique within a given system. The identified entity may have a different 'id' in a different
          system, or may refer to an 'id' for the shared concept in another system (e.g. a CURIE).
      type:
        # TODO should this have an enum range if it's referencing types from VA schema?
        # TODO not sure if this needs the discriminator
        description: >-
          The schema class that is instantiated by the data object. Must be the name of a class from
          the VA schema.
        required: true
  ValueEntity:
    is_a: Entity
    description: >-
      ValueEntity is the root class for classes that instantiate Value Objects. ValueEntity classes
      are not extensible and MUST NOT have optional properties.
    # TODO does this mean we should be manually marking everything as required?
    attributes:
      id:
        range: CURIE
        description: >-
          The 'logical' identifier of the entity in the system of record, and MUST be represented as a CURIE.
          This 'id' is unique within a given system, but may also refer to an 'id' for the shared concept in
          another system (represented by namespace, accordingly).
  DomainEntity:
    is_a: ValueEntity
    description: >-
      An abstract :ref:`ValueEntity` class extended to capture specific domain entities by reference
      to an external identifier.

      id:
        required: true
  ExtensibleEntity:
    is_a: Entity
    description: >-
      ExtensibleEntity is the root class for classes that instantiate Extensible Objects. Extensible
      Objects are extensible using the extensions property and MAY have optional properties.
    attributes:
      label:
      extensions:
        multivalued: true
        range: Extension
        # ordered?
  Extension:
    description: >-
      The Extension class provides VODs with a means to extend descriptions
      with other attributes unique to a content provider. These extensions
      are not expected to be natively understood under VRSATILE, but may be
      used for pre-negotiated exchange of message attributes when needed.
    attributes:
      type:

  RecordMetadata:
    is_a: ExtensibleEntity
    description: >-
      A re-usable structure that encapsulates provenance metadata that applies to a specific
      concrete record of information as encoded in a particular system, as opposed to
      provenance of the abstract information content/knowledge the record represents.

      A `coding` is an extensible entity for labeling or otherwise annotating globally
      namespaced identifiers known as "codes".
